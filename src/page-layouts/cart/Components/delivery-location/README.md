## DeliveryLocation Component

## Overview
The `DeliveryLocation` component allows users to enter a delivery PIN code, select an address from existing addresses, and add new addresses. It manages modals for PIN code entry, address selection, and adding new addresses.

## Features
- **PIN Code Management**: Users can enter and validate a delivery PIN code.
- **Address Selection**: Users can select from default and other available addresses.
- **Add New Address**: Users can add a new address with location details.

## Usage
To use the `DeliveryLocation` component, you need to import it into your React application and provide the required props.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import DeliveryLocation from 'fdk-react-templates/page-layouts/cart/Components/delivery-location/delivery-location';
import 'fdk-react-templates/page-layouts/cart/Components/delivery-location/delivery-location.css';

const App = () => {
  const pincode = "123456";
  const pinError = { message: "Invalid PIN code" };
  const defaultAddressList = [{ id: "1", address: "123 Main St, City, State" }];
  const additionalAddressList = [{ id: "2", address: "456 Side St, City, State" }];
  const currentlySelectedAddressId = "1";
  const googleMapsApiKey = "YOUR_MAP_API_KEY";
  const addressSelectionError = { id: "1", message: "Address not deliverable" };

  return (
    <DeliveryLocation
      pincode={initialPincode}
      error={pinError}
      isPincodeModalOpen={true}
      isAddressModalOpen={false}
      isAddAddressModalOpen={false}
      defaultAddress={defaultAddressList}
      otherAddresses={additionalAddressList}
      selectedAddressId={currentlySelectedAddressId}
      mapApiKey={googleMapsApiKey}
      showGoogleMap={true}
      getLocality={(pincode) => console.log(`Fetching locality for ${pincode}`)}
      selectAddress={() => console.log('Address selected')}
      addrError={addressSelectionError}
      onChangeButtonClick={() => console.log('Change PIN code clicked')}
      onAddButtonClick={() => console.log('Add new address clicked')}
